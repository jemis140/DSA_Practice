# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin(0, 0).

# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance(i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

# You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique(except for the order that it is in).

# Solution: find all distances sort them and return points
