"""Steps:

Sort the tasks according to start time, remember to keep a reference to the original task index
tasks = [[start_time, process_time, original_index], ..., ...]
Set the current time to the first start time in the task list.
Push all tasks whose start time is â‰¤ the current time into heap h.
heapq.heappush(h, (process_time, original_index))
Notice we don't care about start time, since we know any item pushed into
the heap is already past it's start_time.
Pop the first task to be processed.
Increase the current time by the processed time.
